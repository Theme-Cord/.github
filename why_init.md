## Why Need to Initialize in ThemeCord

In order to import the CSS style into Discord, it is necessary to initialize the ThemeCord application. This initialization process allows ThemeCord to inject the custom styling into the Discord client, providing the desired visual changes.

To initialize ThemeCord, follow these steps:

1. Open **ThemeCord**;

2. Click on **Initialize**;
*Note: Make sure discord is open*

3. Wait until **Home page shows**;


By performing these steps, the ThemeCord application will be properly initialized and ready to import the CSS style into Discord, allowing you to customize its appearance.

*Note: Make sure to have the required permissions and necessary CSS style file available before initialization.*
